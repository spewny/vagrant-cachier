# Dnf

Used by Fedora guests, will get configured under guest's `/var/cache/dnf`. It will
also [make sure](lib/vagrant-cachier/bucket/dnf.rb#L20) that `keepcache` is set to
`true` on guest's `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`.

To manually enable it:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = 'some-fedora-box'
  config.cache.enable :dnf
end
```

### :warning: Notice about Windows hosts :warning:

In case this bucket is enabled and a Windows host is in use, you might see an
ugly stacktrace as described on [this comment](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier/issues/117#issuecomment-50548393)
if some Yum repository is not available during provisioning.
